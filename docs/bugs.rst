Bugs
----

There is a bug in `Doxygen <https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen>`_ which results in `FORTRAN INCLUDE statements not being parsed <https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/3461>`_. Until this gets fixed then there is little point in providing `Doxygen <https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen>`_ comments in the source code here. The bug was reported on 2009-07-27 and it shows no sign of being fixed (I first commented on the bug report on 2013-01-11 and as of 2022-05-13 it is still open).
